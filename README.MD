# Node Js Starter #1: tectkbstrnod1

This starter covers the very basics of a Node.Js project.

## Actions Applied to This Starter

* Opening VS Code from the command prompt
* Creating app.js and displaying 'Hello World' on the command line
* Where to find Node.Js libraries ([Node.js web site](http://nodejs.org/api))
* Using the 'fs' internal library to write 'Hello World' to a file
* Using variables to hold 'Hello World'
* Using \r\n to end each line in the file

## End of Module Challenge

* Change the message displaying on the console to: The "Hello World" was appended to the file on {today's date}.
* {today's date} above should come from a variable called "today", and it can be set using the function Date.now().
* It will display how you would expect it to.  We will discuss why in the next lesson.
